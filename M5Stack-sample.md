# M5 Stack Sample

## caution

This is not the hardware paulus used in his videos for the demonstration. The M5Stack atom echo is sold **out**. So, I used another hardware without a speaker!

The "M5Stack ATOM Lite ESP32 Development Kit" with "M5Stack PDM MEMS Microphone Unit (SPM1423)" were used. The M5Stack Atom Echo needs another pin configuration!

The setup was just for demonstration, you should **never** power your matrix via the esp32!!!
